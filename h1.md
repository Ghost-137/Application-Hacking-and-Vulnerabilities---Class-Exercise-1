# ISMS Scope and Management: Mobile Study Lab Environment

## 1. Baseline: ISMS Scope

### 1.1 What is Included (In-Scope)

This ISMS describes the devices, software, network, and data I use to complete and submit my cyber-security coursework..

#### Hardware (The Physical Layer)
- **Apple MacBook Air (M1)**: The primary host machine where all local computation, documentation, and virtualization occur.
- **iPhone (Personal Hotspot)**: The central network gateway. It manages local IP assignments (DHCP) and acts as the bridge to the internet.
- **Mobile Phone (Identity)**: The same device is also a critical security asset used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to protect cloud identities.

#### Virtual Environments (The Lab Layer)
- **UTM (Universal Turing Machine)**: The virtualization software used to run x86/ARM operating systems on Apple Silicon.
- **Ubuntu Linux VM**: The dedicated, "disposable" workspace where all technical course exercises are performed.

#### Information Assets (The Data Layer)
- **Course Intellectual Property**: Technical reports, source code, and configuration files.
- **Access Credentials**: SSH keys, GitHub tokens, and login credentials for the school portal.
- **Lab Datasets**: Any data downloaded or generated during exercises.

### 1.2 What is Excluded and Why

#### Mobile Carrier Infrastructure (ISP)
The external 4G/5G mobile network and the provider's NAT/Gateway.
**Justification**: No administrative control. I cannot configure the carrier's firewall or view their logs.

#### Untrusted Guest Devices
A friend's mobile device that occasionally connects to the personal hotspot.
**Justification**: I do not have administrative access to this device to enforce security policies (updates, malware scanning). It is treated as an "untrusted guest" and excluded from the secure scope.

#### Secondary Personal Devices
My personal iPad and Windows laptop which share the hotspot connection.
**Justification**: To maintain a lean, auditable scope, these devices are excluded as they are not used for this specific course.

### 1.3 Key Interfaces

#### External Cloud Services
- **GitHub**: Primary version control and code integrity platform.
- **Google Drive / Outlook**: Off-site storage for documents and course communication.
- **School Portal**: The official interface for academic submission.

#### Network Boundary
The iPhone's cellular radio interface serves as the logical boundary between the "Untrusted" Internet and the "Trusted" Personal Area Network (PAN).

#### Virtual Boundary
The network bridge between the macOS Host and the Ubuntu Guest VM inside UTM.
